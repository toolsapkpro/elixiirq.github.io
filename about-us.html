                            <p><strong>HOW ELIXIRNET WORKS?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;What is Elixir? What exactly what do we do on Elixir Platform ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;ELIXIR, Whose motto says; &ldquo;Connect digitally, experience beyond magicals&rdquo; is a multiracial and all embracing integrated system whose ambitions and aspirations is to connecting our users to unlimited extensive and global financial opportunities. We offer our users unlimited ways of accessing universal opportunities such as automated products generation and exchanging spanning e- books, arts and Shares. We also grant to our users artistry and advanced 22nd skills, providing them with great commissions in sales and odds to successful internet marketing voyage in General.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BELOW IS HOW YOU EARN AS A NON- AFFILIATE &amp; AS AN AFFILIATE ON ELIXIR.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>We offer over ten different ways that allow our users experience beyond magically through digital connectivity. Below are the ways you will earn &amp; gain values as a Non - Referral user.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>REGISTRATION/CASHBACK BONUS; I</strong>mmediately you are done registering, we offer wide varieties of cashback &amp; Enrollment packages such as&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>N5,000 Instant cashback bonus which you can withdraw&nbsp;-</li>
<li>FREE Facebook monetization course that worths N50,000 which you will get for FREE</li>
<li>FREE Arts &amp; NFTs which you can automatically resell on our website.</li>
<li>Access to Premium e-Book on how to earn N200,000 monthly with ELIXIR</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>HEPTAD COLLABORATION:</strong> This is the grandest digital invention that improves &amp; maximize digital marketing &amp; communication which aids successful network marketing between individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heptad collaboration fosters team work, following the adage that says &ldquo;If you walk together, you will go far&rdquo; Hence, we have invented a way our users can even get paid daily spillovers worth N5,000 by automatically being under an active team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>PAYMENTS PER VIEWS ON TIKTOK</strong>;&nbsp; This works in a way that any video you upload about Elixir on Tiktok, we pay you N1250 for 1k Views. If you have 20,000 Views, that&rsquo;s around N25,000 and so on. This money can be withdrawn as well after proper review and organic confirmation &amp; verification of these views on your TikTok page. Even Non affiliate users will benefit from this, just create videos, get views and get paid!</p>
<p>&nbsp; <strong>SOCIAL MEDIA MONETIZATION&rsquo;3</strong>; This is another opportunity we are introducing to the Elite users. It&rsquo;s another way to Monetize their social media account, especially TikTok &amp; IG.&nbsp; This doesn&rsquo;t require huge number of views or engagement, what we are interested in is how good and creative you are in making the videos. With this, we pick randomly daily and credit such users up to N5000 daily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>AUTOMATED PRODUCTS GENERATION &amp; EXCHANGES</strong>; This is a Feature that has been designed in away that can make the Elites earn at least $1.2 per each art generated and exchanged automatically.&nbsp; Automated products generation work in a way that a user can automatically create a product that has been uploaded for that day on their account. Such Products are e-Books, Stock Markets, Artworks and NFTs.&nbsp; Once generated, they go on and exchange it automatically to money( their local currency) on their account, and that&rsquo;s all. All these will take less than a minute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>FACEBOOK MONETIZATION;&nbsp;</strong>As we all know, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook CEO has liaised with Nigeria and facebook monetization for Nigerians will start ending of this June. We have employed the best of the bests to train our users how to monetize their Facebook accounts and get paid even outside our project.&nbsp;We have packaged and confined this training in such a way that Immediately a user is done with registration, it would automatically be forwarded to such users&rsquo; email. They don&rsquo;t need huge number of friends to get paid from Facebook, they only need tricks we will be giving them.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; <strong>SELL YOUR CREATIVITIES &amp; TALENTS TO US, WE ARE BUYING;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><strong>Not</strong> only Arts we buy, we also buy every kinds of talents, creativities and skills. We are in the world and majorly in a country where talents become dead, where people&rsquo;s innovations are not being appreciated, recognized or rewarded just because they are not known. Say Bye bye to such days. So far you are an Elixir user, we are interested in greatness that is in you and we are also ready to bring out the potentials in you. Each upload can grant you up to N15,000</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>STAKE WITH NOTHING &amp; WIN SOMETHING;&nbsp;</strong>Most especially to the Sport people here. We have also made it in such a way that our user can participate in Elite sport prediction using part of their Non Affiiate Earnings. They will be taught as well, but winners getting credited is based on first come and first serve. More info will be dropped prior to launching. I believe this will aid selling and getting referrals. Each correct prediction can grant you up to N10,000</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>THE ELITE INTER- USER GAME</strong>; Here, two users can stake part of their earnings ( Commission or Shares funds ) and participate in inter user game, Winner of this game will automatically have the staked funds deposited in his/her wallet. Mikey &amp; I might decide to play game and bet 50,000 each. Winner will get N100,000.&nbsp; Remember, there is also inter - Heptad game. Where &ldquo;Team dashboard funds&rdquo; will be used as staked funds to participate in the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>TENACIOUS ON ELIXIR</strong>; Tenacious on Elixir is an Unending weekly contest where everybody is a winner. You can make N50,000 weekly or N200,000 Monthly with Tenacious. User with highest number of referrals every week will be credited N50,000 Reward. It&rsquo;s the least in the reward models we have set up.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>THE MUSKETEERS OF REWARD ON ELIXIR;</strong>The Musketeers on Elixir is a 3 Methodologies of incentives we have introduced. What you were used to is getting incentives when you have higher number of sales/ referrals. We will be introducing something different on Elixir.&nbsp;</p>

<ul>
<li>Sales commission of N5,1000</li>
